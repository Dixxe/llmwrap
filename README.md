# LLMwrapp

A framework written in rust, that gives you simple control over your LLM models and their parametrs!


## Roadmap

- Refactor all main.rs

- Use dotenv for model loading

- Implement async functions and streaming output of the model

- Add support for all models that supported by `rustformers` crate

## Installation

Install `llmwrap` via git

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dixxe/llmwrap.git
  cd llmwrap
```
Now install any Llama **GGMLv3** language model and put it inside folder.
